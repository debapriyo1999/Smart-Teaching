# Smart-Teaching
This project aims to promote the online teaching culture started after the covid-19 scene and gives a suitable platform for local teachers to go their classes from offline to online. This will be an android app having all the necessary features required for classes like notes download, meeting links , even fee payment if possible test-taking also in a simpler manner than other apps.
